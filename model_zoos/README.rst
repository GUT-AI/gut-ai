Representation Learning Models (RLMs)
-------------------------------------

DTMs are **task-agnostic** models which are typically used at the Downstream Task. They are typically trained using *Self-Supervised Learning*, but Supervised and (narrow-sense) Unsupervised Learning can also be used.

Downstrem Task Models (DTMs)
----------------------------

DTMs are **task-specific** models which are typically used at the Downstream Task. They are typically trained using *Supervised Learning*, but Self-Supervised and (narrow-sense) Unsupervised Learning can also be used.
