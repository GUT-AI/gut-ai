Representation Learning Models (RLMs)
-------------------------------------

Note: DTMs are **task-agnostic** models which are typically used at the **state of Preprocessing** (which is sometimes wrongly called "pretraining" phase). They are typically trained using *Self-Supervised Learning*, but Supervised and (narrow-sense) Unsupervised Learning can also be used. The end goal is to extract dense **representations / features / embeddings**.

Downstrem Task Models (DTMs)
----------------------------

Note: DTMs are **task-specific** models which are typically used at the **Downstream Task**. They are typically trained using *Supervised Learning*, but Self-Supervised and (narrow-sense) Unsupervised Learning can also be used. The end goal depends on the specific task.
