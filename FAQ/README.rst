FAQ

The following is a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list.

**1. What is GUT-AI?**

Read about it on `About <../README.rst#about>`_.

**2. Does the GUT-AI Foundation promote Open-Source?**

YES! The Foundation is 100% an Open-Source First organization. The vision, mission and the business model are such that the Foundation will always remain 100% Open-Source First. More details in the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_.

**3. Does the GUT-AI rely only on one or a few Blockchain networks?**

No, not at all. The Free and Open-Source Software produced, promoted or enabled by the Foundation is entirely Blockchain-agnostic.

**4. Have you issued your own crypto coin?**

Not yet, but we are planning to. An additional whitepaper (or lightpaper) will be released about the new crypto coin. And before we do that, we want to engage the community and receive feedback. This is why we have released the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_ of the Foundation. More details there.

**5. Will the software be restricted only to AI solutions?**

No, the software will also include open-source business tools (like CRM, CMS, E-commerce platforms) with full interoperability to AI plugins in order to solve real-life, practical problems in the industry. It will also include the implementation of a decentralized Marketplace for products and services offered by third-party Freelancers in order to provide holistic and customized solutions to businesses and individuals alike. More details in the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_.

**6. On the network side, how do you deal with Sybil attacks and consensus?**

Good question. Similar to Bitcoin, it’s dealt by Game Theory, thus making Sybil attacks financially expensive and also difficult to execute successfully. The consensus mechanism of AGI (placeholder name) is a hybrid PoW and PoS mechanism. It is very similar to Proof of Activity (PoA), which has already been verified to work in practice with Decred coin. More details in the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_.
