The following is a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list.

|br|

**1. What is GUT-AI?**

Read about it on `About <../README.rst#about>`_.

**2. Does GUT-AI Foundation promote Open-Source?**

YES! The Foundation is 100% an Open-Source First organization. The vision, mission and the business model are such that the Foundation will always remain 100% Open-Source First. More details in the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_.

**3. Does the GUT-AI rely only on one or a few Blockchain networks?**

No, not at all. The Free and Open-Source Software produced, promoted or enabled by the Foundation is entirely Blockchain-agnostic.

**4. Have you issued your own crypto coin?**

Not yet, but we are planning to. An additional whitepaper (or lightpaper) will be released about the new crypto coin. And before we do that, we want to engage the community and receive feedback. This is why we have released the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_ of the Foundation. More details there.

**5. Will the software be restricted only to AI solutions?**

No, the software will also include open-source business tools (like CRM, CMS, E-commerce platforms) with full interoperability to AI plugins in order to solve real-life, practical problems in the industry. It will also include the implementation of a decentralized Marketplace for products and services offered by third-party Freelancers in order to provide holistic and customized solutions to businesses and individuals alike. More details in the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_.

**6. On the network side, how do you deal with Sybil attacks and consensus?**

Good question. Similar to Bitcoin, it’s dealt by Game Theory, thus making Sybil attacks financially expensive and also difficult to execute successfully. The consensus mechanism of AGI (placeholder name) is a **hybrid** PoW and PoS mechanism. It is very similar to Proof of Activity (PoA), which has already been verified to work in practice with Decred coin. More details in the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_.

**7. Is GUT-AI Initiative and GUT-AI Foundation one and the same?**

No, not at all. The GUT-AI Foundation is merely a *pure subset* of the GUT-AI Initiative. The GUT-AI Foundation has a *supportive* role, while acting as a catalyst in order to **accelerate** the GUT-AI Initiative, but *without interfering* with the **decentralized** nature of the whole initiative. In other words, the GUT-AI Foundation is merely a *pure subset* of the GUT-AI Initiative. An unlimited number of individuals, projects, foundations, companies and other organizations anywhere on the planet can join the Initiative in an unrestricted way. There is no authorization or permission needed (or granted) in order to join the Initiative, since it is entirely **permisionless**. Just use the logo if you want to signal to others that you have joined the GUT-AI Initiative. That's it. You are good to go.

**8. Is GUT-AI Foundation and GUT-AI Network one and the same?**

No, not at all. In order to join the Foundation, you will need to purchase its dedicated governance token. In order to participate in the Network, you will need to buy the AGI utility token. Crucially, the Network and the Foundation have distinct, independent and completely unrelated governance systems with one another. In other words, governance token holders do not influence the Network in any way, and likewise, utility token holders do not influence the Foundation in any way. Also, more than one foundations can be active in the Network on an equal basis with the GUT-AI Foundation, which will have no "special privileges" within the Network. More details in the `Whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/bxw4h>`_.

**9. Do the Co-Founders or Genesis members of the Foundation get any "special privileges"?**

No, not at all. Co-Founders and Genesis members don’t get any "special privileges", but each one of them is something like *primus inter pares* (i.e. first among equals). This ensures that all subsequent members who will join later on will not be disadvantaged in any way.

**10. Is the GUT-AI leaderless?**

No, not at all. Conversely, both the GUT-AI Foundation and the GUT-AI Initiative are **'leaderfull'**.
