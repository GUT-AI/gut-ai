# Components

__Sumary:__ The GUT-AI initiative is subdivived into a series of components (i.e. sub-projects) in order to build a *user-friendly* __Open-Data, Open-Source, Decentralized ecosystem__ under the umbrella of the [GUT-AI Foundation](../README.md#dao-foundation). This is a list of all the components of such an ecosystem.

It is important to note that each component definition intentionally does not include *how* to be implemented, but only *what* to be implemented. The reason is that there should be __no constraints or limits__ on the 'how' since new advances in Technology can potentially bring new opportunities to improve the 'how' a specific component is implemented. The 'why' each component is necessary is explained above and also in the [Vision](../README.md#vision) and [Mission](../README.md#mission) of GUT-AI. The aim of the GUT-AI initiative is *not* to reinvent the wheel. If a tool or solution for something already exits, then an integration can be created for that tool or solution.
