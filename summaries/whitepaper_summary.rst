**Write a summary in 120 words of this PDF.**

The GUT-AI whitepaper discusses the impact of centralization on innovation, specifically in the generation of scientific discoveries, commercialization of research findings, and the growth of commercialized research findings. It emphasizes the need for a system that fosters healthy competition and innovation. The paper also explores the evolution of the Web from Web1 to Web3, focusing on the 'what' rather than the 'how' to allow for maximum creativity. It highlights the importance of user-friendliness and security in this context. The concept of a decentralized community (DeCom) is introduced, where households are interconnected without the need for a centralized authority. The authors clarify that the views expressed are their own and not necessarily those of the GUT-AI Foundation, and that the whitepaper is intended to solicit feedback from the public.
