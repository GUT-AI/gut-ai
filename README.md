## About

### Pitch

The GUT-AI initiative is an initiative which aims to eliminate the *multiple, single-points-of-failure* when using AI for real-life applications in the *real world* in order to achive the ultimate purpose of both ‘narrow AI’ and ‘strong AI’, which is to actually "open" the "black box" of an ML system in order to eventually unlock the mysteries of nature and the universe (from Brain Consciousness and Abiogenesis to Quantum Gravity and Genesis Cosmology). 

### Vision

We believe that there should be no organization or person in our world who wants to use AI, but not be able to do so. We also believe in a world where AI hand in hand with human interaction are in an ever-improving situation.

### Mission

We are on a mission to create the most *user-friendly* __Open-Data, Open-Source, Decentralized ecosystem__ for AI using cutting edge technology either of the 21st century or that we might invent ourselves.

## Main papers

### Research Proposal

__Coming soon!__

### Whitepaper

__Coming soon!__

## DAO Foundation

The __GUT-AI Foundation__ has a *supportive* role, while acting as a catalyst in order to accelerate the GUT-AI Initiative, but *without interfering* with the __decentralized__ nature of the whole initiative. In other words, the GUT-AI Foundation is merely a *pure subset* of the initiative.

### Selected publications

__Coming soon!__

### Current Problems and Challenges

The Problems and Challenges that currently exists in our world are the following:
* countless of centralized “solutions” in the cyberspace
no interoperability
limited communication
inefficient processes
multiple single-points-of-failure
bureaucratic hegemony
censorship
no privacy
security vulnerabilities
