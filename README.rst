About
-----

Pitch
^^^^^

The GUT-AI initiative is an initiative which aims to eliminate the *multiple, single-points-of-failure* when using AI for real-life applications in the *real world* in order to achive the ultimate purpose of both ‘narrow AI’ and ‘strong AI’, which is to actually "open" the "black box" of an ML system in order to eventually unlock the mysteries of nature and the universe (from Brain Consciousness and Abiogenesis to Quantum Gravity and Genesis Cosmology). 

Vision
^^^^

We believe that there should be no organization or person in our world who wants to use AI, but not be able to do so. We also believe in a world where AI hand in hand with human interaction are in an ever-improving situation.

Mission
^^^^

We are on a mission to create the most *user-friendly* **Open-Data, Open-Source, Decentralized ecosystem** for AI using cutting edge technology either of the 21st century or that we might invent ourselves.

DAO Foundation
--------------

The **GUT-AI Foundation** has a *supportive* role, while acting as a catalyst in order to accelerate the GUT-AI Initiative, but *without interfering* with the **decentralized** nature of the whole initiative. In other words, the GUT-AI Foundation is merely a *pure subset* of the initiative.

Current problems and challenges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, there are countless centralized “solutions” in the cyberspace, but with the following problems and challenges:

* no interoperability
* limited communication
* inefficient processes
* multiple single-points-of-failure
* bureaucratic hegemony
* censorship
* no privacy
* security vulnerabilities
